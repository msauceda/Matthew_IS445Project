    <h2 class="spacing">About Myself</h2>
    <p>My interest in information tehnology began at a young age and has grown to me majoring in Information Systems.  I enjoy the challenges that come with trying to figure out programming and hope to one day build websites that will be an effective tool for any business.</p>
    <p>I have learned a lot as an undergraduate and hope to continue on in a Master&#39;s program in the near future.&nbsp; My learning of information systems has just begun and I am ready to tackle what is to come in my career.</p>
    <p>Best wishes!</p>
